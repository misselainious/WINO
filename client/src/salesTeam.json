Her southern charm was a delightful addition to the Marin and Sonoma County wine scene. Her passion for small production, old world style wines led her to join the WineWise team and share those wines with the discerning palates of her area. Elizabeth prides herself in great customer service and has a real knack for finding just the right wine for that place in the wine list. Aside from work you can find her on early morning hikes on the beautiful Marin coastline or trying to keep up with her busy daughters."

      "bio": "Marc West-Teixeira started his career working in some of San Francisco’s most well-known and loved restaurants and wine spots (Eos Wine bar, Lulu’s Restaurant, Azie) working behind the bar and on the floor as restaurant manager and sommelier. Wine became more and more of an interest for him during his work day, and in his evenings as he dove into exploring the worlds of wine. Moving off the restaurant floor and onto the streets, he filled his first wine bag and hit the streets of San Francisco and never looked back. Marc has worked all through Northern California as well as taking a four-year stint in Minnesota where he was the sales director of the Fine Wine Portfolio of Quality Wines and Spirits. A believer in wines with heart, he is especially excited by wine made by growers that honor tradition, but are not afraid to change in an effort to better communicate the place from which they are grown."

Diving right into it, he simultaneously attended wine school, worked in wine retail, and helped open the first Vino Volo wine bar at Dulles Airport. After becoming a certified Sommelier in 2006, Brian directed several different wine programs in the DC area (including lists for José Andrés and Wolfgang Puck) before trekking to the Bay Area in 2011 to run a few more. After brief stints conducting curated wine tours around Northern California, and other wine education and consulting, Brian is now proudly spreading the good word of WineWise on the Peninsula and South Bay."

His first job in the wine trade started at the age of 22, working for one of the larger wine companies, and quickly learned that side of the wine world wouldn’t keep his interest. Eventually the draw of the boutique wine importer and portfolio would attract his attention and heart, and keep it to this day. The warm and nourishing home Matt found at Wine Wise has never faded or failed to stoke his passion. Now a long term resident of Big Sur, and steward to Wine Wise’s most beautiful sales territory, Matt co-founded the Big Sur Food and Wine Festival and serves as their Vice President and Wine Director. Additionally, Matt is the Sommelier at Sierra Mar Restaurant at The Post Ranch Inn and consults for a couple local wine programs."

After a career path that included the music business and working in nearly every type of restaurant job, John graduated from The California Culinary Academy in San Francisco. His formal wine training began at Robert Mondavi Winery where he rose to the level of Senior Wine Educator and specialized in teaching both the public and the restaurant trade about wine and food. Eventually John settled in Los Angeles, where he proudly represents our fantastic and devoted producers."

Nicole prides herself on her Midwest work ethic, honest relationships, and (at least according to her mom), her ability to make friends with a wall. She married her Minnesota sweetheart and they live happily away from the snow with their two daughters. More than anything, Nicole drinks the wine she likes and believes that everyone else should, too."

In her spare time she teaches Spin Class and Yoga and obsessively scuba dives whenever she can get somewhere warm."
