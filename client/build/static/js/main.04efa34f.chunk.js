Diving right into it, he simultaneously attended wine school, worked in wine retail, and helped open the first Vino Volo wine bar at Dulles Airport. After becoming a certified Sommelier in 2006, Brian directed several different wine programs in the DC area (including lists for Jos\xe9 Andr\xe9s and Wolfgang Puck) before trekking to the Bay Area in 2011 to run a few more.

His first job in the wine trade started at the age of 22, working for one of the larger wine companies, and quickly learned that side of the wine world wouldn\u2019t keep his interest. Eventually the draw of the boutique wine importer and portfolio would attract his attention and heart, and keep it to this day. The warm and nourishing home Matt found at Wine Wise has never faded or failed to stoke his passion. Now a long term resident of Big Sur, and steward to Wine Wise\u2019s most beautiful sales territory, Matt co-founded the Big Sur Food and Wine Festival and serves as their Vice President and Wine Director.

Then, pursuing her passion of all things fermented, Allyson followed her heart back to the Central Coast and joined the WineWise team. Allyson is a Certified Wine Judge through U.C.

After a career path that included the music business and working in nearly every type of restaurant job, John graduated from The California Culinary Academy in San Francisco.

If they are grown organically it does not hurt, but we don\u2019t insist on it. While we have a number of sought-after and expensive wines in our portfolio, our animating force is the acquisition of great wines that almost anyone can afford to drink \u2013 a rather more exacting discipline than the converse. Above all, we like people. Our growers tend to be interesting and often amusing people, sometimes with a spiritual bent, sometimes unrepentantly earthy. We have watched with pleasure as the sons and daughters we knew as babies and children have grown up to be the proprietors of their parents\u2019 estates. We like to think of ourselves as the link between these friends and the people drinking their wines in restaurants or at home. We have developed from an essentially one-man band into a team with a dozen or so sales representatives spanning virtually the entire state of California and a small phalanx of impossibly clever people handling the many functions that lie beyond the principals\u2019 capabilities.

Despite the proto-socialist character of the place (famed leftist Edmund Penning-Rowsell was its long-serving Chairman), daily drinking consisted mostly of aged classed-growth Bordeaux and fine burgundy.
